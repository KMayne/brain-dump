Writing your ideas, tasks and thoughts on to paper can be a great way to keep track of and process what's on your mind. However, paper notes are hard to edit, becoming messy and disorganised as time goes on. Paper can also be a pain to carry around and you don't always have a surface to write on.

There are apps for note taking and to do list making but these can be too rigid to use to organise the ideas you can't categorise yet. What about putting tasks into an Urgent-Important graph?

BrainDump is a web app that aims to bring the best parts of paper to an app. Use cards like sticky notes to represent ideas then drag them around freely.

Tip: Ctrl-Click cycles a notes colour.
